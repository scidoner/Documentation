## What is the Windows Store Torrent Remote app?

The  Torrent Remote app  for the Windows Store allows you to connect remotely to any computer running the uTorrent program.  

For more information about uTorrent, see here:  [http://www.utorrent.com/](http://www.utorrent.com/)  

> **Warning**
> 
> The  Torrent Remote app  is  **not**  a standalone torrent
> downloader/torrent client. Its sole purpose is to connect to and
> manage a remote instance of uTorrent. Because of this, we would kindly
> ask that you do not leave negative feedback or low app ratings on the 
> [Windows Store
> page](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/utorrent-client/e52814e4-c3f8-49d5-8ec4-bf27140cc8df)
> if you mistakenly thought that this app is a standalone torrent client
> (i.e. please read the description of this app on its  [Windows Store
> page](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/utorrent-client/e52814e4-c3f8-49d5-8ec4-bf27140cc8df)).
> 

> **Note**
> 
> The  Torrent Remote app  is compatible only with the Microsoft Windows
> version of the uTorrent desktop program and thus the guides in this
> documentation refer to setting up on a Microsoft Windows computer
> only.

>**Tip**
>
> If you are completely sure and familiar with the set up and usage of
> the uTorrent Web UI, or you already have it successfully configured,
> you do not need to follow any information in this documentation.
> However it is here for your reference should you run into any
> troubling circumstances using the  Torrent Remote app  with the
> uTorrent Web UI.

## What can I do with it?

When connected remotely with the  Torrent Remote app, you are able to view all of your torrent jobs that are running on the remote computer. It is possible to view jobs by their label or status (downloaded, completed, etc). Each job in the list has the capability to be controlled - i.e. you are able to  **start**,  **stop**,  **pause**, and  **remove**  torrent jobs using the  Torrent Remote app. You can also add brand new torrent jobs from either a  **.torrent file**  on your local computer, or a  **torrent file URL**  or  **magnet link**.

Any of these actions will occur at the remote end - meaning you can use the  Torrent Remote app  like it were a remote control for your computer running the uTorrent program.

## What does this mean for me?

In order for all of this functionality to work, the uTorrent program provides a feature called the Web UI. This is a small web service/API which allows third-parties to connect to it over the Internet (or on a local network, too!)

Unfortunately, however it does require a little bit of setting up from you, the end user. But that's not to worry, it isn't hard at all! Just follow the links below to get started setting up your Web UI connection so you can use it with the  Torrent Remote app  for the Windows Store!
